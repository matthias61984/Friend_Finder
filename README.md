# Friend Finder

This browser-based application will match you with the most like-minded person in the application. When a user submits their answers, they are added to the friends.js array and become a possible outcome for future submissions. The logic uses Math.abs(), looping through all the friends in the array to return the friend with the lowest difference in scores in a modal.
